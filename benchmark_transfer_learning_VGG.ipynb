    "Hi! I am  [Jean-Nicolas Jérémie](https://laurentperrinet.github.io/author/jean-nicolas-jeremie/) and the goal of this notebook is to provide a framework to implement (and experiment with) [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) on deep convolutional neuronal network (DCNN). In a nutshell, [transfer learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/transfer-learning-using-vgg16-in-pytorch/) allows to re-use the knowlegde learned on a problem, such as categorizing images from  a large dataset, and apply it to a different (yet related) problem, performing the categorization on a smaller dataset. It is a powerful method as it allows to implement complex task *de novo* quite rapidly (in a few hours) without having to retrain the millions of parameters of a DCNN (which takes days of computations). The basic hypothesis is that it suffices to [re-train the last classification layers](https://www.kaggle.com/carloalbertobarbano/vgg16-transfer-learning-pytorch) (the head) while keeping the first layers fixed. Here, these networks teach us also some interesting insights into how living systems may perform such categorization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our [previous work]( https://laurentperrinet.github.io/sciblog/posts/2020-09-28-benchmarking-cnns.html), we will start from a [VGG16 network](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_vgg/) loaded from the [`torchvision.models` library](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/vgg.py) and pre-trained on the [Imagenet](http://image-net.org/) dataset wich allows to perform label detection on naturals images for $K = 1000$ labels. Our goal here will be to re-train the last fully-Connected layer of the network to perfom the same task but in a sub-set of $K = 10$ labels from the Imagenet dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we are going to evaluate different strategies of transfer learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* VGG General : Substitute the last layer of the pyTorch VGG16 network ($K = 1000$ labels) with a new layer build from a specific subset ($K = 10$ labels).\n",
    "* VGG Linear : Add a new layer build from a specific subset ($K = 10$ labels) after the last Fully-Connected layer of the the pyTorch VGG16 network.\n",
    "* VGG Gray : Same architecture as the VGG General network but trained with grayscale images.\n",
    "* VGG Scale : Same architecture as the VGG General network but trained with images of different size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will use the [pyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library for running the networks and the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html) library to collect and display the results. This notebook was done during a master 2 internship at the Neurosciences Institute of Timone (INT) under the supervision of [Laurent PERRINET](https://laurentperrinet.github.io/). It is curated in the following [github repo](https://github.com/JNJER/2020-06-26_fast_and_curious.git).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- TEASER_END -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In our [previous work]( https://laurentperrinet.github.io/sciblog/posts/2020-09-28-benchmarking-cnns.html), as the VGG16 network was first trained on the entire dataset of $K=1000$ labels, and in order to recover the classification confidence predicted by the model according to the specific subset of classes ($K = 10$ labels) on which it is tested, the output `softmax` mathematical function of the last layer of the network was slightly changed. By assuming that we know *a priori* that the image belongs to one (and only one) category from the sub-set the probabilities obtained would correspond to a confidence of classification discriminating only the classes of interest and can be compared to a chance level of $1 /K$. This creates another network (which is not retrained) directly based on VGG:\n",
    "\n",
    "* VGG Subset : Just consider the specific subset ($K = 10$ labels) from the last layer of the pyTorch VGG16 network ($K = 1000$ labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims in addition to test this hypothesis. Our use case consists of measuring whether there are differences in the likelihood of these networks during an image recognition task on a sub-set of $1000$ classes of the `ImageNet` library, with $K = 10$ (experiment 1). Additionally, we will implement some image transformations as up/down-sampling (experiment 2) or transforming to grayscale (experiment 3) to quantify their influence on the accuracy and computation time of each network.\n"

Such framework is thus promising for further applications which aim at modelling higher-order cognitive processes."
